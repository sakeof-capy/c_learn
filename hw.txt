1.  Implement analogies to functions 
z remove an element from both static and dynamic arrays 
but assume that the array is sorted. (Use binary search).

2.  Understand what "extern" and "const" mean in C 
and get to know why we needed "extern"
for declaring the constants 
(error codes of remove_first_ignore_order() 
and remove_first_preserve_order() and find_index());

3.  Rewrite the error codes of the functions 
so that they are organized as enum rather then as a set of constants

4.  Measure time of removing elements from array 
using functions remove_first_ignore_order() and remove_first_preserve_order()
in a way similar search_exe.c.
